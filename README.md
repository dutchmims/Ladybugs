# Deployment

### Version Control Software

* Github within Git
1. From my profile I chose a new repository and its then created with or without a template. It just needs to be named. 
2. Once your repository is built and loaded, you click on Gitpod to phyically build your code. You use the file directory to create files and folders for your site.
3. Once code has been created you need the to type "git add ." in the Gitpod terminal to add new code.
4. Then you need to commit the new code by typing  "git commit -m" including your comments of what you have just saved.
5. Then you need to type "git push", this command will push your committed changes to your GitHub repository.

### Deployment

* The site was deployed to GitHub pages. The steps taken are as follows:
1. Log in to Github.
2. In the repository "Ladybugs", navigate to the settings tab from the top menu.
3. In settings select pages.
4. From the source section, select the "Master Branch" and then save.
5. The page is refreshed and you will then see the URL of your website in a few minutes.
