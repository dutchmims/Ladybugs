# Design

## Colours

* The colours that I chose for the website are as follows.  A soft pink rgb(245, 201, 235) for the background colour of the home page and play area and a grey hex #686868 for the title, score, container border, font, back of cards, border of cards face up and social media icons.

## Main Background Colour

* The background colour used is a soft pink rgb(245, 201, 235) as it is easy on the eye, playful, bright and gives an overall fell of ease and accessability.

## Font Colour

* The font colour used is a grey hex #686868 as it contrasts nicely with the background colour.

## Font

* The font I chose was Allerta Stencil as it is easy to look at, its also quite a playful/retrofont which lends itself well for this website/game.

## Unfixed Bugs
* There are no bugs that I am aware of.

# User Testing & Responsiveness 

* The website was tested rigorously on Mozilla Firefox through the design process. 

* The website was tested on Chrome and Safari browsers with no issues and performing as expected

* The website was tested on numerous sized screens including iphone 12, 13” MacBook and an ipad and responded as expected on all devices.

# Deployment 

## Version Control 

* Github within Git
1. From my profile I chose a new repository and its then created with or without a template. It just needs to be named. 
2. Once your repository is built and loaded, you click on Gitpod to phyically build your code. You use the file directory to create files and folders for your site.
3. Once code has been created you need the to type "git add ." in the Gitpod terminal to add new code.
4. Then you need to commit the new code by typing  "git commit -m" including your comments of what you have just saved.
5. Then you need to type "git push", this command will push your committed changes to your GitHub repository.

## Deployment

* The site was deployed to GitHub pages. The steps taken are as follows:
1. Log in to Github.
2. In the repository "Ladybugs", navigate to the settings tab from the top menu.
3. In settings select pages.
4. From the source section, select the "Master Branch" and then save.
5. The page is refreshed and you will then see the URL of your website in a few minutes.
